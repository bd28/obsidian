# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian vault - a knowledge management and note-taking system, not a software development project. Obsidian stores notes as Markdown files and configuration in the `.obsidian` directory.

## Key Information

- **File Format**: All notes are Markdown files (.md)
- **Configuration**: Stored in `.obsidian/` directory (JSON format)
- **Sync Enabled**: This vault has Obsidian Sync enabled

## Working with Obsidian Files

When creating or editing notes:
- Use standard Markdown syntax
- Internal links use `[[Note Name]]` syntax
- Tags use `#tag-name` format
- Code blocks support syntax highlighting with ` ```language` notation

## Current Structure

- `Welcome.md` - Example note demonstrating Obsidian features
- `.obsidian/` - Contains all Obsidian configuration files
